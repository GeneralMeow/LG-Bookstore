# LG-Bookstore


## General Commands for local setup:

1. Clone into git directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/EthanJStark/LG-Bookstore.git
```

2. Change into bookstore directory:

```
cd LG-Bookstore
```
3. Setup the database:
  We used homebrew to install postgres. There are two options for starting the postres server; this process chooses the automatic start up on login.

```
> brew install postgres
> brew services start postgresql
> psql createdb bookstore
> createdb bookstore
> psql bookstore < schema.sql
```

3. Start Server:

```
npm start
```

4. View our app by going to [The Bookstore](http://localhost:3000/) on your browser once you have started the server locally.
